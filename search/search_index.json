(\uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c? \uc65c?) \u00b6 This is a plugin embedding a whole Python VM (versions 3.x [the default and suggested one] and 2.7) In Unreal Engine 4 (both the editor and runtime). \uc5b8\ub9ac\uc5bc \uc5d4\uc9c4 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c\uc740 \uc5b8\ub9ac\uc5bc \uc5d4\uc9c44 \uc5d0 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c VM\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\ud55c (\uc5d0\ub514\ud130 \ubc0f \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784) \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The Python VM tries to give easy access to all of the UE4 internal api + its reflection system. This means you can use the plugin to write other plugins, to automate tasks, to write unit tests and to implement gameplay elements. \ud30c\uc774\uc36c VM \uc740 \uc5b8\ub9ac\uc5bc \ub0b4\ubd80 API \uc640 \ub9ac\ud50c\ub809\uc158 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc804\uccb4\uc5d0 \uc27d\uac8c \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778 \uc81c\uc791, \uc5c5\ubb34 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654, \uc720\ub2db \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8, \uac8c\uc784 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc694\uc18c \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. It is not meant as a way to avoid blueprints or c++ but as a good companion to them (albeit reducing the amount of c++ required for coding a game could be an interesting thing ;). If your development pipeline is already python-based (Maya, Blender, ...), this plugin could easily help you in integrating unreal into it. \ube14\ub8e8\ud504\ub9b0\ud2b8\ub098 C++ \ub97c \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 (C++ \ucf54\ub529\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294\ub370) \uc88b\uc740 \ub3d9\ubc18\uc790 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud560 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uac1c\ubc1c \ud30c\uc774\ud504 \ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \uc774\ubbf8 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \uae30\ubc18(\ub9c8\uc57c, \ube14\ub80c\ub354, ...)\uc774\ub77c\uba74 \uc5b8\ub9ac\uc5bc \uc5d4\uc9c4 \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub420 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In addition to this, the plugin automatically adds an actor class (PyActor), a pawn class (PyPawn), a character class (PyCharacter) and a component class (PythonComponent) for \"gentle\" integration of python in your games. \uc774\uc678\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc561\ud130(PyActor), \ud3f0(PyPawn), \uce90\ub9ad\ud130(PyCharacter), \ucef4\ud3ec\ub10c\ud2b8(PythonComponent)\ub4f1\uc774 \ucd94\uac00\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uac8c\uc784\ub0b4 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c\uc744 \"\uc820\ud2c0\ud558\uac8c\" \ud1b5\ud569\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2a4\ub2c8\ub2e4. In the spirit of automating tasks, even wrappers for third party libraries used by UE4 are exposed in a 'pythonic' way. As an example the FbxSdk is exposed to allow low-level interaction with Fbx files. This is an example extracting animation curves: https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython/blob/master/examples/fbx_curves_extractor.py \uc5c5\ubb34 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc368\ub4dc \ud30c\ud2f0 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac \ub7a9\ud37c\ub4e4\uc744 '\ud30c\uc774\uc36c\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4' \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 Fbx \ud30c\uc77c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud574 FbxSdk \uac00 \uc81c\uacf5\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc74c\uc740 \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158 \ucee4\ube0c\ub97c \ubf51\uc544\ub0b4\ub294 \uc608\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. Another funny feature (well, a side effect ;) is that you can change your python code even after the project has been packaged. You can potentially build a completely new game from an already packaged one.

Once the plugin is installed and enabled, you get access to the 'PythonConsole' item in the 'Development Menu', you can use it to trigger python commands directly from the editor.

Installation from sources On Linux (64 bit) \u00b6 Currently the suggested distribution is Ubuntu Xenial (LTS 16.04) 64bit. Obviously you need to already have an Unreal Engine build (note that on ubuntu xenial you need to install the clang-3.5 package to build the editor). Both python2.7 and python3.5 are supported and the default configuration assumes python3 (so ensure to install the python3-dev package). Create a new C++ project and close the editor once the project is fully started go to the just created project directory and create the Plugins folder move to the Plugins folder and clone the plugin repository: git clone https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython re-open your project, this time you will get a popup asking you for re-building the python plugin. Choose yes and wait. NOTE: always run your project from a terminal so you can see startup logs (they are really useful when building the plugin the first time, if you cannot build the plugin, open an issue on github pasting the related log lines). If you want to use python2 (or another specific version) just edit the Source/UnrealEnginePython/UnrealEnginePython.Build.cs file and change the pythonHome string accordingly (ensure to have the python2.7-dev package installed). Upgrade the plugin on Linux \u00b6 Just remove the .so files in Plugins/UnrealEnginePython/Binaries/Linux and pull the latest code. At the next run the build procedure wil be started again.

(self.uobject \ub780?) \u00b6 To allow seamless Python integration, each UObject of the engine is automatically mapped to a special Python Object (ue_PyUObject). \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d4\uc9c4\ub0b4 UObject \ub4e4\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud2b9\uc815 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \uc624\ube0c\uc81d\ud2b8( ue_PyUObject )\ub85c \ub9f5\ud551\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To be more clear, a call to: \uc880 \ub354 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uc790\uba74, \uc544\ub798 \uac19\uc740 \ud638\ucd9c\uc774 \uc788\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0 text_render_component = unreal_engine . find_class ( 'TextRenderComponent' ) will internally search for the 'TextRenderComponent' class (via unreal c++ reflection) and when found will check if it is available in the cache, otherwise it will create a new ue_PyUObject object that will be placed in the cache. \ub0b4\ubd80\uc801\uc73c\ub85c 'TextRenderComponent' \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c (\uc5b8\ub9ac\uc5bc c++ \ub9ac\ud50c\ub809\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574) \uac80\uc0c9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud574\ub2f9 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \ucc3e\uc544\ub0b4\uba74 \uce90\uc2dc\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c\uc9c0 \uccb4\ud06c\ud558\uace0 \uc544\ub2c8\uba74 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 ue_PyUObject \ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud574 \uce90\uc26c\uc5d0 \ub123\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. From the previous example the 'text_render_component' maintains a mapping to the UObject (well a UClass in this example). \uc704 \uc608\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c text_render_component \ub294 UObjectd \uc758 \ub9f5\ud551(\uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 UClass)\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. Pay attention: the python class you map to the PyActor (or PyPawn, PyCharacter or PyComponent), is not a ue_PyUObject. It is a classic python class that holds a reference (via the 'uobject' field) to the related ue_PyUObject mapped object. The best technical term to describe those classes is 'proxy'. \uc8fc\uc758: PyActor (\ub610\ub294 PyPawn, PyCharacter \ub610\ub294 PyComponent)\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\ub294 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub294 ue_PyUObject \uac00 \uc544\ub2d9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uac83\uc740 \ud074\ub798\uc2dd \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub85c ue_PyUObject \ub9e4\ud551\ub41c \uac1d\uccb4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucc38\uc870\ub97c ('uobject'\ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574) \ubcf4\uc720\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubb38\uc801\uc778 \uc6a9\uc5b4\ub85c\ub294 '\ud504\ub85d\uc2dc'\ub77c\uace0 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The 'World' concept '\uc6d4\ub4dc' \ucee8\uc149 \u00b6 Every actor is mapped to a world (UWorld in c++).

While it is pretty rare to reference other worlds, you may need to compare the world of two uobject's (for example you may have a reference in your python module to a uobject of a hidden world and you want to check if you need to use it). \ub2e4\ub978 \uc6d4\ub4dc\ub97c \ucc38\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\uc740 \uadf9\ud788 \ub4dc\ubb38\uc77c\uc774\uae34 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac04\ud639 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc6d4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \uc624\ube0c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud574\uc57c\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\u3134\ub2e4.

The uobject api \u00b6 Each uobject represent a UObject class of the Engine. This C++ class is basically the root of all the other classes (Actors, Pawns, components, properties ...). Thanks to Unreal Engine reflection system we do not need to implement a python class for each unreal engine class, but for performance reason we expose the most common methods. The uobject system checks for the type of the mapped C++ UObject and will call the method only if it is safe to call it. \uac01 \uc624\ube0c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc758 UObject \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774 C++ \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc758 \ubd80\ubaa8 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Sometime methods are implemented for automatically getting the right object. As an example get_actor_location() when called over a component will automatically retrieve the related actor and will call C++ AActor::GetActorLocation() method over it. \ub54c\ub54c\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc624\ube0c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc5bb\uc5b4\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uba54\uc18c\ub4dc\ub4e4\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 get_actor_location() \uc740 \ucef4\ud3ec\ub10c\ud2b8\uc0c1 \ud638\ucd9c\ub420 \ub54c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc561\ud130\ub97c \ucc3e\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c C++ AActor::GetActorLocation() \uba54\uc18c\ub4dc\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud574\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. When this automagic approach is too risky, the method will check for the uobject type and will raise an exception in the case of inconsistencies. \uc774\ub7f0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ub9c8\ubc95 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \ud310\ub2e8\ub420 \ub54c uobject \uc758 \ud0c0\uc785\uc744 \uccb4\ud06c\ud574 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0\uc54a\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc608\uc678\ub97c \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0a4\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. Remember, there is no need to implement every single engine class method, the reflection system is powerful enough to be governed only via properties and function calls (check the uobject call() method) \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d4\uc9c4 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uba54\uc18c\ub4dc\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud560 \ud544\uc694\ub294 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ac\ud50c\ub809\uc158 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\ud37c\ud2f0\uc640 \ud391\uc158 \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574\uc11c\ub9cc \uc81c\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uac15\ub825\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. (uobject call() \uba54\uc18c\ub4dc\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud574\ubcf4\uc138\uc694) Most-used methods are implemented directly as uobject methods for performance reasons. \uac00\uc7a5 \ube48\ubc88\ud558\uac8c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uba54\uc18c\ub4dc\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc0c1\uc758 \uc774\uc288\ub85c uobject \uba54\uc18c\ub4dc\ub85c \uc9c1\uc811 \uad6c\ud604\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Integration with Qt4/Qt5/PySide2 \u00b6 Thanks to solid GIL management, you can integrate Qt python apps in Unreal Engine 4. Pay attention to not call app.exec_() as it will result in Qt taking control of the UE loop. Instead use a ticker to integrate the Qt loop in the editor loop: ## save it as ueqt.py import sys import unreal_engine as ue import PySide2 from PySide2 import QtWidgets app = QtWidgets . QApplication ( sys . argv ) def ticker_loop ( delta_time ): app . processEvents () return True ticker = ue . add_ticker ( ticker_loop ) now you can start writing your gui (this is a simple example loading asset thumbnail): import ueqt from PySide2 import QtCore , QtWidgets , QtGui import unreal_engine as ue from unreal_engine import FARFilter _filter = FARFilter () _filter . class_names = [ 'SkeletalMesh' , 'Material' ] class MyWidget ( QtWidgets . QWidget ): def __init__ ( self ): super () . __init__ () self . vertical = QtWidgets . QVBoxLayout () self . scroll = QtWidgets . QScrollArea () self . content = QtWidgets . QWidget () self . scroll . setWidget ( self . content ) self . scroll . setWidgetResizable ( True ) self . layout = QtWidgets . QVBoxLayout () for asset_data in ue . get_assets_by_filter ( _filter , True ): try : thumbnail = asset_data . get_thumbnail () except : continue label = QtWidgets . QLabel () data = thumbnail . get_uncompressed_image_data () image = QtGui . QImage ( data , 256 , 256 , QtGui . QImage . Format_RGB32 ) label . setPixmap ( QtGui . QPixmap . fromImage ( image ) . scaled ( 256 , 256 )) self . layout . addWidget ( label ) self . content . setLayout ( self . layout ) self . vertical . addWidget ( self . scroll ) self . setLayout ( self . vertical ) widget = MyWidget () widget . resize ( 800 , 600 ) widget . show () root_window = ue . get_editor_window () root_window . set_as_owner ( widget . winId ()) (no need to allocate a new Qt app, or start it, as the UE4 Editor, thanks to to ueqt module is now the Qt app itself) Note the 2 final lines: they 'attach' the Qt window as a 'child' of the editor root window. Note that on windows platform this is not simple parenting but 'ownership'. Memory management \u00b6 Dealing with 2 different GC's is really challenging. Starting from release 20180226 a new memory management system has been added (FUnrealEnginePythonHouseKeeper, available here https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython/blob/master/Source/UnrealEnginePython/Public/PythonHouseKeeper.h). This new system is completely integrated with the Unreal Engine reflection-based GC and will hold track of each ue_PyUObject abd the related UObject to understand when a python object can be safely destroyed. The same system works for delegates, as well as Slate. More details here: https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython/blob/master/docs/MemoryManagement.md Unit Testing \u00b6 The repository includes the tests/ directory from which unit tests will be run. To run the unit tests (ensure to run them on an empty/useless project to avoid messing with assets) run the following commands from the ue4 python console: import unreal_engine as ue ue . py_exec ( ue . find_plugin ( 'UnrealEnginePython' ) . get_base_dir () + '/run_tests.py' ) if you plan to add new features to the plugin, including a test suite in your pull request will be really appreciated ;) Threading \u00b6 Since release 20180624 threading is fully supported. As with native threads, do not modify (included deletion) UObjects from non-main threads. Accessing Python Proxy From UObject \u00b6 Sometimes you may have a UObject and know that it is backed by a python object. To get the python object from the UObject, use the get_py_proxy method. For example, imagine you have the following situation: There is a PyActor sub-class called PyExplosiveActor which has Explosive as its python class. The Explosive has a go_boom python method. There is a PyActor sub-class called PyBadGuyActor which has a Blueprint property called MyBomb and a python class called BadGuy . The BadGuy instance in python knows that its UObject has its MyBomb as an instance of PyExplosiveActor and wants to call the go_boom python method. This would be resolved as shown below: import unreal_engine as ue class Explosive : 'Python representation for PyExplosiveActor in UE4' def go_boom ( self ): # do python stuff to explode ... self . uobject . destory () class BadGuy : 'Python reprsentation for PyBadGuyActor in UE4' def ignite_bomb ( self , delay ): bomb = self . uobject . MyBomb py_bomb = bomb . get_py_proxy () py_bomb . go_boom () What is going on here in BadGuy is that self.uobject is a reference to the PyActor UObject and self.uobject.MyBomb is a reference to the PyExplosive uobject. But instead you want to access its proxy class ( Explosive ). The get_py_proxy() method returns the python custom class, Explosive that the PyExplosiveActor object is mapped to. Status and Known issues \u00b6 Exposing the full ue4 api is a huge amount of work, feel free to make pull requests for your specific needs. We still do not have a plugin icon ;) We try to do our best to \"protect\" the user, but you can effectively crash UE from python as you are effectively calling the C/C++ api Contacts and Commercial Support \u00b6 If you need commercial support for UnrealEnginePython just drop a mail to info at 20tab.com Follow @unbit on twitter for news about the project Special Thanks \u00b6 Such a big project requires constant sponsorship, special thanks go to: Kite & Lighting http://kiteandlightning.la/ (they are sponsoring various areas of the project, expecially the slate api) GoodTH.INC https://www.goodthinc.com/ (they are sponsoring the sequencer api) Quixel AB https://megascans.se/ (built their integration tool over UnrealEnginePython giving us tons of useful feedbacks and ideas)","title":"UnrealEnginePython"},{"location":"rosetta/UnrealEnginePython/#readme","text":"https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython/blob/76ae4b11bfd1cf46db0b191657c0ec2263b12741/README.md Embed Python in Unreal Engine 4 \uc5b8\ub9ac\uc5bc \uc5d4\uc9c44 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 Teaser (by Kite & Lightning): https://twitter.com/KNLstudio/status/932657812466843648 \ud2f0\uc838 Fixing Mixamo RootMotion tuturial: https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython/blob/master/tutorials/FixingMixamoRootMotionWithPython.md \ubbf9\uc0ac\ubaa8 \ub8e8\ud2b8 \ubaa8\uc158 \ud29c\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc5bc \uc218\uc815 Funny snippets for working with StaticMesh and SkeletalMesh assets: https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython/blob/master/tutorials/SnippetsForStaticAndSkeletalMeshes.md \uc2a4\ud0dc\ud2f1 \uba54\uc26c\uc640 \uc2a4\ucf08\ub808\ud0c8 \uba54\uc26c \uc560\uc14b \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub294 \uc2a4\ub2c8\ud3ab \ubaa8\uc74c More tutorials: https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython/tree/master/tutorials \ucd94\uac00 \ud29c\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc5bc","title":"README"},{"location":"rosetta/UnrealEnginePython/#how-and-why","text":"This is a plugin embedding a whole Python VM (versions 3.x [the default and suggested one] and 2.7) In Unreal Engine 4 (both the editor and runtime). \uc5b8\ub9ac\uc5bc \uc5d4\uc9c4 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c\uc740 \uc5b8\ub9ac\uc5bc \uc5d4\uc9c44 \uc5d0 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c VM\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\ud55c (\uc5d0\ub514\ud130 \ubc0f \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784) \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

It is not meant as a way to avoid blueprints or c++ but as a good companion to them (albeit reducing the amount of c++ required for coding a game could be an interesting thing ;).

In addition to this, the plugin automatically adds an actor class (PyActor), a pawn class (PyPawn), a character class (PyCharacter) and a component class (PythonComponent) for \"gentle\" integration of python in your games. \uc774\uc678\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc561\ud130(PyActor), \ud3f0(PyPawn), \uce90\ub9ad\ud130(PyCharacter), \ucef4\ud3ec\ub10c\ud2b8(PythonComponent)\ub4f1\uc774 \ucd94\uac00\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uac8c\uc784\ub0b4 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c\uc744 \"\uc820\ud2c0\ud558\uac8c\" \ud1b5\ud569\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2a4\ub2c8\ub2e4. In the spirit of automating tasks, even wrappers for third party libraries used by UE4 are exposed in a 'pythonic' way. As an example the FbxSdk is exposed to allow low-level interaction with Fbx files. This is an example extracting animation curves: https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython/blob/master/examples/fbx_curves_extractor.py \uc5c5\ubb34 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc368\ub4dc \ud30c\ud2f0 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac \ub7a9\ud37c\ub4e4\uc744 '\ud30c\uc774\uc36c\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4' \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 Fbx \ud30c\uc77c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud574 FbxSdk \uac00 \uc81c\uacf5\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc74c\uc740 \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158 \ucee4\ube0c\ub97c \ubf51\uc544\ub0b4\ub294 \uc608\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. Another funny feature (well, a side effect ;) is that you can change your python code even after the project has been packaged. You can potentially build a completely new game from an already packaged one.

Once the plugin is installed and enabled, you get access to the 'PythonConsole' item in the 'Development Menu', you can use it to trigger python commands directly from the editor.

There is a PyActor sub-class called PyBadGuyActor which has a Blueprint property called MyBomb and a python class called BadGuy . The BadGuy instance in python knows that its UObject has its MyBomb as an instance of PyExplosiveActor and wants to call the go_boom python method. This would be resolved as shown below: import unreal_engine as ue class Explosive : 'Python representation for PyExplosiveActor in UE4' def go_boom ( self ): # do python stuff to explode ... self . uobject . destory () class BadGuy : 'Python reprsentation for PyBadGuyActor in UE4' def ignite_bomb ( self , delay ): bomb = self . uobject . MyBomb py_bomb = bomb . get_py_proxy () py_bomb . go_boom () What is going on here in BadGuy is that self.uobject is a reference to the PyActor UObject and self.uobject.MyBomb is a reference to the PyExplosive uobject. But instead you want to access its proxy class ( Explosive ). The get_py_proxy() method returns the python custom class, Explosive that the PyExplosiveActor object is mapped to.","title":"Accessing Python Proxy From UObject"},{"location":"rosetta/UnrealEnginePython/#status-and-known-issues","text":"Exposing the full ue4 api is a huge amount of work, feel free to make pull requests for your specific needs.
